# Cervical-Cancer-Risk-Prediction

# Overview:
This GitHub repository contains code for predicting cervical cancer risk using machine learning techniques. The code encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation. The dataset used includes various features related to individuals' demographics and medical history to predict the risk of cervical cancer.

# Repository Structure:
Code Files:
cervical_cancer_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for cervical cancer risk prediction.

Dataset:
cervical_cancer.csv: The dataset used for training and testing the predictive models.

# Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: The dataset underwent cleaning procedures such as handling missing values and converting data types for statistical analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualization techniques like heatmaps and age distribution histograms were utilized to gain insights into the data.
Model Building: Models such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Random Forest were developed for predicting cancer risk.
Cross-Validation: The models were evaluated using cross-validation techniques to ensure robust performance assessment.
Bagging Classifier: Ensemble learning techniques like Bagging were implemented to enhance model accuracy and stability.

# Instructions to Run the Code:
Ensure you have Python installed along with relevant libraries like pandas, numpy, sklearn, etc.
Download the cervical_cancer.csv file containing the dataset.
Execute the cervical_cancer_prediction.ipynb Jupyter Notebook to run the code and analyze the results.

# Results:
